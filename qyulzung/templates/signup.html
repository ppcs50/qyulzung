            <small>Welcome to Qyulzung! Have you ever heard about this word before? I guess not, since it's not a familiar word as "<a class="kimchi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi">Kimchi</a>".</small>
            <small>It is literally means 'Decision'. Just pronunciate it whatever you want, and when you met some Korean friends, ask how properly pronunciate. They will gladly teach you and definitely smile while you trying to pronunciate. :)</small>

        <div class="col">
            <small>This is a web application for a decision-making worksheet, based on the famous rational decision-making model.</small>
